\section{Historical Exhibition on Tea Cultivation in Assam during the British Colonial Era}

A critical review of conflict and harmony in a colonial context of the Ichang Riot exhibition in Yichang Museum, China was recently conducted. The review presented opportunities for better understanding historical accounts of various events from differing contexts and perspectives.

The state of Assam is known throughout the world for it’s tea and tea cultivation industry as well as oil production. With the historical root of tea cultivation in Assam being during it’s occupation by the British in early 1800s, the topic provides a good base ground to offer differing perspectives on events that lead to the discovery, rise, fall and eventual growth of tea cultivation in the state during the British colonial era.

This pilot study for the project was conducted in parallel to the literature review. The goal was to follow the curatorial process understood then and learn from the findings that could be implemented on the main project.

For the study, objects were collected through visual imagery, textual information and documented videos on the internet. The data was used to create a timeline of events since the British discovered the tea plant in Assam in 1823. Images collected were from books, newspapers, and by photographers.

\subsection{Discussion}

An extensive search was conducted on the internet, but not enough objects could be collected to proceed to any further step. The reasons for failure in the collecting stage are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Inaccessibility to unpublished sources at the National museums.
 \item Unavailability of published sources online.
 \item Unavailability of physical books published in the late 19th and early 20th century
 \item Even though in the public domain, it was not easy to download the sources from the repositories of libraries and museums.
 \item Sources found all scenarios from the British point of view and not from that of the Indian population.
 \item Most objects found produced a disjoint and dissociated narrative.
 \item Push for a capitalist narrative post-independence that lead to the disappearance of various sources due to negligence.
\end{itemize}
 
It is hence better recommended to find a collection of objects before finalising the topic. A readily available corpus of information and objects could lead to a successful exhibit. The immediate task is to find a corpus of objects, images, texts, and audio that could be used for the purpose and lead to finalising the topic for this project. The corpus could be found in one of two ways:
\begin{itemize}
 \item A location that is accessible to the curator. This could be the campus of the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, the Amingaon area, or Guwahati city.
 \item A partnership with an institution or museum could provide a collection of objects for the project.
\end{itemize}


\section{Experimental Exhibition around the Students of the Department of Design}

Unable to find a collection of objects that could be curated, it was decided to create the collection from scratch instead. As discussed earlier, the 'do it' project provides instructions for visitors to participate and create artefacts for the exhibition. Going on similar terms, the project swayed towards designing and organising activities that could help create a collection that could be eventually curated for an exhibition. For the close proximity, students of the Department of Design were chosen to participate in these activities.

\subsection{Pre-exhibition activities and experiments}

A series of activities to create the required collection for the exhibit. Students of the Department of Design would participate in these activities through appropriate means as stated below. The activities are designed taking into consideration various aspects of curation as learned about in the literature review phase of the project. The activities are divided into 3 broad categories on the basis of the way they are to be conducted:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Individual activities
 \item Group activities
 \item Open activities
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Individual Activities}

\noindent
\textit{\textbf{Activity:} Self-portraits with Artificial Intelligence (AI)}

\textit{Background:} Since the early 1960s, scientists and artists have been working on procedural 'rule-based' generation of images using mathematical patterns and algorithms which simulate brush strokes and effects. More recently, this has been expanded to generate images based on various text prompts. These images are formed from a database of millions of artworks and images collected to train these AI models. Using existing artworks and images from databases has led to new legal and ethical challenges for AI-generated artworks. Most of these challenges follow around the choice of an artist to participate and provide their work for these databases and if they would prefer their style to be used by others with/without appropriate credit. Proper control and rights for the artists, clearly marked and tagged AI images, demonetising AI-generated images, and stopping such programs for abusive or hateful content have been suggested as possible solutions. Getty Images, one of the world's biggest suppliers of stock images and editorial photography, has banned AI-generated content across their platforms over fears of legal challenges.

\textit{Information:} For the activity, the participant would provide a detailed prompt to describe their self-portrait that they would like to use to create an AI-generated self-portrait.

\textit{Context:} As design students, they are expected to keep up with much information related to continually evolving design and technology practices. AI-generated content is one such evolution of the past decade being implemented across platforms. The activity provides an opportunity to get hands-on experience with this novel technology for their design practice. A self-portrait also helps them better understand themselves as it is a representation created by them.

\textit{Medium:} Digitally created via Midjourney and colour printed on 4”x4” uncoated card stock.

\textit{Preservation:} Digitally preserved and archived as well as appropriately stored and available for physical display in the future.

\textit{Resources:} Online form. Uncoated A3 paper. Colour printer.

\textit{Budget:} INR 3500 (Midjourney + printing 400 portraits).

\textit{Time Frame:} Through December 2022.

\vspace{1cm}
\noindent
\textit{\textbf{Activity:} Favourite Design}

\textit{Information:} For the activity, the participant would provide a details about their favourite design.

\textit{Context:} As design students, we are often questioned about what is design and at times to give examples for the same. At one point or the other, each designer forms their own sense to evaluate designs from the general practice. Questioning a large population of designers could provide interesting details about the collective understanding of design.

\textit{Medium:} Digitally collected via an online form and colour printed on 3”x3” uncoated card stock.

\textit{Preservation:} Digitally preserved and archived as well as appropriately stored and available for physical display in the future.

\textit{Resources:} Online form. Uncoated paper. Colour printer.

\subsection{Future Work}
Activities will be conducted starting in the month of December 2022 and continue until 15 February 2023. All artefacts collected until then would be then used to curate the exhibition. Participatory co-curation sessions would be organised and conceptualisation of the exhibit would be completed. Possibly, the exhibition would take place in April 2023 during Ishanya. The final deliverables for the exhibition would include:
\begin{itemize}
 \item curated collection of artefacts
 \item organising an exhibition in a physical space
 \item exhibition guide and other associated material
 \item digital archive of artefacts
 \item instructional guide to recreate activities for future students
 \item learning from the whole process
\end{itemize}
