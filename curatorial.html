                <li>focus on method, interpretation and representation of the curatorial inquiry</li>
                <li>has a conventional due date, but benefits from a more extended period of observing design-in-use, thus longer than conventional design processes</li>
                <li>follows more loosely defined goals</li>
                <li>acts on an ad hoc basis as ideas develop</li>
                <li>acceptance as knowledge-in-the-making, use of newer methods</li>
                <li>active relational research sites with multiple dialogues and multivoicedness</li>
                <li>cultivate trust and openness between the curator and the audience</li>
                <li>creative performance using the world to think about, and both affirm and transform, the world</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-5 h4 text-muted">Information</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>unable to collect sufficient or substantive data</li>
                <li>archival information produced through editorial contextualization</li>
                <li>variations should be acknowledged with their possibilities and limitations</li>
                <li>vast "super-modern" period where large amount of historical data produced</li>
                <li>material legacy of this period is abundant</li>
                <li>tapping into local networks of responsible resource stewards</li>
                <li>most memories of a place are possessed only by those who stayed in and experienced the place as it unfolded</li>
                <li>many historical events are inaccessible to the public, thus there exists a gap in knowledge and understanding of an object or place's significance</li>
                <li>devoid of proper documentation and curation, information about the events will remain unknown and eventually vanish</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="img-fluid w-75 mx-auto d-block" src="images/project1/img17.png">

            <h3 class="mt-5 h4 text-muted">Context</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>objects carry intrinsic value and meaning but may take on new extrinsic meanings over time and therefore carry the potential for re-appropriation</li>
                <li>an interesting puzzle for a curator to unearth by finding the true meaning in the appropriate context for an object</li>
                <li>historically, decorative arrangement of items took precedence over categorization or displays of data</li>
                <li>challenge of translating the local experience of reality to the whole world</li>
                <li>editor must seek to place the documentation within its historical context, signalling necessary details to increase its intelligibility and utility</li>
                <li>ensuring non-selective engagement with modern history is notoriously difficult due to the structuring impact of official 'lieux de memoire'</li>
                <li>reflect the current politics of representation amid the global transformation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-5 h4 text-muted">Narrative</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>project's scope settles, think about how to communicate the research</li>
                <li>gives voice to the structure of memories for observers to empathise</li>
                <li>different elements used in conjunction achieve meaningful experiences</li>
                <li>ongoing debates around the world affect the narrative</li>
                <li>relationship between the objects and their textual commentary, spatial design, and modes of display, is essential for the narrative</li>
                <li>done with care without hurting any local or cultural communities</li>
                <li>various narratives to choose from on the subject, which helps understand the subject from different perspectives, but selectively curated</li>
                <li>lack of consistent and comprehensible documentation leads to a disconnected narrative</li>
                <li>"How might such decontextualized objects speak for themselves?"</li>

The museum has continuously struggled to create a comprehensive narrative for the collection.</small></p>
            <h3 class="mt-5 h4 text-muted">Collaboration</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>conversations raise new perspectives and questions, which help to expand the scope of understanding and interpretation of an exhibit</li>
                <li>curator has now become a conductor rather than a controller</li>
                <li>collective action and cross-sector coordination are more effective than an isolated activity of an individual or an organisation</li>
                <li>empowering other voices – not the museum or the curator’s own</li>
                <li>community, educators, collectors, researchers, and private enterprises</li>
                <li>‘new museums’ explore how to include wider groups of people in the creative processes as participants, co-creators, or co-workers</li>
                <li>‘participatory museums’ shift from an inward collection focus toward outward attention to social responsibility and community building</li>
                <li>affects the timespan of exhibition making</li>

            <h3 class="mt-5 h4 text-muted">Preservation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>rapid development has led to increased efforts to conserve historical heritage worldwide</li>
                <li>crucial to maintain both the object and its meaning and value</li>
                <li>objects also reflect assigned values as they were often retained by a creator or custodian because of an assignment of significance</li>
                <li>private collections are endangered, and preserving them requires extensive documentation and long-term curation</li>
                <li>archival holdings are developed through acquiring primary sources in their original documentary forms and made accessible through on-site and digital access structures</li>
                <li>curating as a preservation through active relations of reciprocity and dialogue</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="img-fluid w-75 mx-auto d-block" src="images/project1/img13.png">
            <p class="text-center mt-3 font-monospace"><small>The Mobile Phone Museum since 2019 has catalogued, labelled, photographed and moved mobile phones to secure storage facility to safeguard the mobile technology heritage. The collection has more than 2400 phones and digitised.</small></p>
            <h3 class="mt-5 h4 text-muted">Medium</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>medium plays a vital role in correctly contextualising the objects and the exhibition</li>
                <li>the correct medium can make valuable heritage resources, vital for teaching, researching and learning accessible, catalogued and discoverable</li>
                <li>focus on design reveals a highly complex relationship between the internal space of a gallery and the objects, which leads to the question of whether a temporal interior design can define the meaning of objects</li>
                <li>more recently, state-of-the-art technology is avaliable for integration with non-centralised museum experiences in creating outdoor experiences</li>
                <li>what are the positive and negative aspects of being able to touch and sense a physical object versus its digital surrogate?</li>
                <li>what is lost or gained while selecting a medium over the other?</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="img-fluid w-75 mx-auto d-block" src="images/project1/img12.png">
            <p class="text-center mt-3 font-monospace"><small>WW1 frontlines have disappeared, but 305 memorial trees in Ypres mark the location of the most motionless frontlines. Using dozens of aerial photographs, the app puts these young elms back in the historical landscape.</small></p>
            <h3 class="mt-5 h4 text-muted">Evaluation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>editorial decisions have varied consequences on the usability of an archived document</li>
                <li>curator must determine the extent to which an edited source can operate reliably as an original source and the readings it can support</li>
                <li>to what extent do the artifactual identities of the edited documents reflect those of the originating sources?</li>
                <li>how does the documentary edition functionally represent the sources in terms of the visual presentation of the documents?</li>
                <li>what is the influence of any editorial amendments to the texts?</li>
                <li>what is the expertise of the documentary editors providing this contextualization?</li>
                <li>conversely, these questions can also be used by the curator to evaluate their own initiative's design and implementation for use by others in the future</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="mt-3 h4 text-muted">Resources</h3>
            <p>As the exhibit moves towards the date of the display, looking at the overall programme, one must identify operational and practical resources - potential contractors, staff allocation, and assigning project budget and venue</p>
